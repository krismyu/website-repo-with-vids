This is supplemental material for *The experimental state of mind in
elicitation: illustrations from tonal fieldwork* that follows up on
Section 2.4, which recast Hyman (2007)'s work on tonotactics in
Thlantlang Lai in terms of experimental design. It introduces additional examples of using 
experimental design principles to generalize to elicitation methods
beyond Pike's toneme discovery procedure.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

These examples are divided into the following sections:

1. [Coarsening and refining variable levels](#levels)
2. [Generalizing to different research questions](#sec:gen-question)

A [references](#references) section follows.

Coarsening and refining variable levels {#levels}
------------------------------------------------

One way to generalize beyond Pike's toneme discovery procedure is to
**generalize beyond the set of variables under consideration.** In
addition to considering other independent variables---explanatory
as well as confounding variables--another way to generalize the set of
variables is if we don’t add any new variables, but we *change*
the definition of some of the variables. We could do this in such a
way so that a re-defined variable is incomparable to the old one. For
instance, we could change the levels for a factor SEGMENT from voiced and voiceless to singleton, geminate, and
supergeminate. But there is no subset/superset relation between the
original levels and the new ones, and this kind of re-defining a
variable is effectively the same as adding a new variable.

There are also two ways we could redefine a variable so that
is still comparable:


1.  Coarsening the partition of the possible instantiations of the
    variable (increasing the number of levels of the variable)

2.   Refining the partition of the possible instantiations of the
    variable (decreasing the number of levels of the variable)

When we coarsen the partition, we reduce the number of levels for a
variable, merging levels with one another. When we refine the partition,
we increase the number of levels for a variable, splitting levels. We
might also both coarsen and refine in re-defining a variable.

One example of coarsening the partition is given in the table below. This is adapted from the study of contextual tonal
variation in Mandarin in Xu (1997, p. 70). The explanatory variable of
tonal class of the target syllable had 4 levels, following the 4-way
tonal contrast in Mandarin (abstracting away from the neutral fifth
tone). However, the explanatory variable of the pre-target tone,
i.e., the tone class of the syllable preceding the target syllable,
collapsed the 4-way distinction for Mandarin tonal classes into a 2-way
distinction based on the tonal offset: both Tone 1, a high tone, and
Tone 2, a rise, were classified as having a high offset, and both Tone 3
(low) and 4 (fall) were classified as having a low offset. In
autosegmental-theoretic terms (Goldsmith 1990, Goldsmith 1976), one
might say that the new variable assumes that contour tones are treated
as tonal sequences (fall = HL, rise = LH) and pays attention only to the
tone at the right edge of the syllable.

  Tone |     Old level |  Mapping  |          New level
  -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | -----------
  Tone 1|   High|        High $\mapsto$ H |  H
  Tone 2|   Rise|        Rise $\mapsto$ H |  H
  Tone 3|   Low |        Low $\mapsto$ L  |  L
  Tone 4|   Fall|        Fall $\mapsto$ L |  L

Another example of coarsening the partition defined by a variable comes
from Keating (2011), a cross-linguistic study of the acoustic parameters
involved in distinguishing phonation types. Here, for the purposes of
standardization for comparison with other languages, the 7-way tonal
contrast in the White Hmong data from Esposito (2012)
was coarsened into a 3-way contrast capturing the rough location of the
tone within the pitch range—either high, mid, or low—for the same data,
for the purposes of the cross-linguistic comparison in Keating (2011),
see the table below:

  Tone |        Old level |            Mapping |           New level
  ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | -----------
  b-tone   |    High-rising |   High-rising $\mapsto$ H  |      H
  null-tone |       Mid     |       Mid $\mapsto$ M      |      M
  s-tone    |       Low     |       Low $\mapsto$ L       |     L
  j-tone    |   High-falling |   High-falling $\mapsto$ H  |     H
  v-tone    |    Mid-rising  |   Mid-rising $\mapsto$ M    |    M
  m-tone    |   Low-falling  |  Low-falling $\mapsto$ L    |    L
  g-tone    |   Mid-falling  |  Mid-falling $\mapsto$ M    |    M

An example of *refinement* of the partition induced by a variable would be
the reverse of the mapping for Mandarin tones in Xu (1997): rather than collapsing a 4-way distinction into a
2-way distinction, one would refine a 2-way distinction into a 4-way
distinction. Another instance of refinement would be the addition of a
level for tonal class upon the discovery of evidence for a new tonal
class in the course of fieldwork.

Those two examples of refinement both involve increasing the number of
levels to some finite number, but refinements may also involve mapping
from a set of a finite number of distinctions, e.g. 4 levels, to a set
of potentially infinitely many distinctions, i.e.the set of *real
numbers*.[^1] An example of this kind of refinement would be changing a
length variable from counting syllables, e.g. 1 syllable, 2 syllables
$\ldots$, to measuring absolute time, e.g. 343.25 milliseconds, 692.11
milliseconds. This kind of refinement might seem intuitively more
drastic than refining a 2-way tonal distinction into a 4-way one, and it
is: it’s a change in variable type (Stevens 1937), similar to a change
in type in type-theoretical semantics (Gamut 1992, Ch.4; Carpenter 1997
Chs. 2, 3).

Generalizing to different research questions {#sec:gen-question}
--------------------------------------------

A more drastic way to generalize beyond Pike’s procedure is to apply
principles of experimental design to other research questions. In this
section, we give examples of research questions treating tone as a
dependent variable rather than an independent variable ([Tone as a DV](#sec:tone-dv)),
including examining phonetic tonal sandhi, i.e. tonal coarticulation, in White Hmong
([Example 1](#sec:hmong)); we also given an example of using a
factorial design in uncovering evidence for a tonal case marker in
Samoan ([Example 2](#sec:samoan)).

### Tone as a dependent variable {#sec:tone-dv}

Thus far in this paper, we’ve considered tonal class as an independent
variable manipulated by the fieldworker, but we’ve never considered
tonal class as a dependent variable. This is not because tonal class
cannot be treated as a dependent variable, but simply due to the nature
of our research questions—we’ve focused on making hypotheses about
possible tonal classes and their reflexes in the pitch contour and
refining these hypotheses.

There are two main situations in which tone might appear in the
dependent variable:

-   in explorations of how tonal contrast is produced and perceived
-   in explorations of phonological allophony and alternation

Some example research questions about exploring the dimensions of tonal
contrast are:

-   What effect does tonal class have on the pitch contour over a word?
-   What parameters in the speech signal are available for
    discriminating different tonal classes?
-   What cues in the speech signal do listeners use to identify tones?

Some examples of work along these lines appear in Connell (2000)
(perception), Khouw (2007) (production and perception), and DiCanio (2009) (production).

In explorations of phonological allophony and alternation, tone makes an
appearance in the dependent variable because the mapping between
underlying tonemes and surface tones (or between surface tones) is of
primary importance. Underlying form is manipulated as an explanatory
variable, and the dependent variable is the surface form. Note that
there must be a linking hypothesis about the mapping from observables
(perhaps the pitch contour over a word) to surface tones in such an
elicitation experiment. We presented an example of a factorial design
in tonal fieldwork exploring allophony in the body of the paper in
Section 2.4.

### Example 1: tonal realization in White Hmong {#sec:hmong}

A similar factorial design for tonal bigrams, but for studying the
phonetic realization of tones in White Hmong (Hmong-Mien, China) is
given below. Since the focus is the acoustic variation induced by tonal
classes, there is a large and detailed set of acoustic dependent
variables.

-   Research question: How are tones in White Hmong acoustically
    realized?

-   Strategy: Control some known sources of variability in tonal
    realization and manipulate others to study a selected range of tonal
    variability.

-   Research hypothesis:

-   Linking hypothesis: Acoustic dimensions relevant for tonal
    discrimination in the production of White Hmong tones include
    f0-based parameters and various spectral parameters.

-   Experimental unit: elicited sentences

-   Explanatory variables
    -   $N_1$ tone: b, n, s, j, g, m, v
    -   $N_2$ tone: b, n, s, j, g, m, v
<p></p>
-   Confounding variables
    -   prosodic position: isolation, sentence-medial
    -   carrier phrase: fixed with two phrases, with target words
        randomly assigned to one of the two phrases
    -   segmental features of words: fully [+sonorant] (fixed)
    -   CV skeleton: CVV (fixed)
    -   pragmatic context: out of the blue (fixed)
<p></p>
-   Dependent variables
    -   mean fundamental frequency
    -   syllable onset fundamental frequency
    -   syllable offset fundamental frequency
    -   mean spectral tilt
    -   mean harmonic-to-noise ratio

  Block |                 IV   |          Levels
  ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------------
  Isolation  |        $N_1$ tone |   b, n, s, j, g, m, v
             |        $N_2$ tone |  b, n, s, j, g, m, v
  Sentence-medial |   $N_1$ tone |  b, n, s, j, g, m, v
                   |  $N_2$ tone |  b, n, s, j, g, m, v

### Example 2: tonal case marking in Samoan {#sec:samoan-abs}

Moving back upwards towards the morphosyntax-prosody interface, this
section gives an example of a 2$\times$2 factorial design examining the
effect of the interaction of case-marking pattern (absolutive-oblique,
ergative-absolutive) and word order (VSO, VOS) on the f0 contour in
Samoan (Polynesian, Samoa), with the goal of examining the hypothesis
that there is a high tone at the left edge of absolutive arguments. The
experimental design involves minimal sets of sentences, keeping
segmental material in test sentences constant except for the segmental
case markers for ergative and oblique case. Some factors are controlled
for optimizing our chances of observing prosodic realization realized in
the f0 contour. First, words are fully sonorant so that the f0 contours
is free from segmental perturbation. Secondly, arguments of long length,
i.e. many words, are used to allow plenty of segmental material for
intonational tonal events to be realized (Bruce 1977).

-   Research question: Does Samoan have a high tone at the left edge of
    absolutive arguments?

-   Strategy: Control any variables suspected to induce variation in
    surface realization of underlying tones and vary case-marking
    pattern and word order. To support our hypothesis, we must find an
    *interaction* effect on the intonational realization in the
    sentence, such that the presence of high pitch peak at the left edge
    of the second argument occurs when the levels of the two factors
    interact such that the second argument has absolutive case.

-   Research hypothesis: Samoan has a high tone at the left edge of the
    absolutive argument.

-   Linking hypothesis: A high tone in Samoan is realized as pitch peak
    realized at the edge of a prosodic word.

-   Experimental unit: elicited sentence

-   Explanatory variables
    -   case-marking pattern: absolutive-oblique, ergative-absolutive
    -   Word order: VSO, VOS
<p></p>
-   Confounding variables
    -   constituent length: long (fixed)
    -   coordination: absent (fixed)
    -   segmental features of words: fully [+sonorant] (fixed)
    -   stress pattern: primary stress on penultimate mora (fixed)
    -   CV skeleton: CVCVCV (fixed)
    -   pragmatic context: out of the blue
<p></p>	
-   Dependent variable: presence of high pitch peak at the left edge of
    the second argument

The 2 $\times$ 2 factorial design is shown in the table below:

  Word order | erg-abs  |   abs-obl
  ----- | ----------- | -----------
  VSO |  V-erg-abs |  V-abs-obl
  VSO |  V-abs-erg |  V-obl-abs


[^1]: The set of *real numbers* contains numbers like 3.0, 1.542, $\pi$,
    2.9, 2.99, 2.999, 2.9999999999999999$\ldots$.
