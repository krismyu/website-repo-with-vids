##<a id="lunches"></a> Mentoring networks and lunches ##

Each junior faculty member will invite **2-3** other faculty members to be
mentors, according to the following guidelines:

1. At least one mentor should be inside your home department
2. At least one mentor should be outside your home department
3. At least one mentor should be senior faculty
4. At least one mentor should be junior (or recently tenured) faculty
5. Mentors need not be listed as [personnel](#personnel) on the grant 

The point of the mentoring network is to be a resource for the initiating
junior faculty member regarding career issues like getting tenure and
funding, how UMass/the department works, teaching, work-life balance,
etc., as well as research ideas and collaborations. 

Over the academic year, each junior faculty member will invite his/her
mentors to lunch to chat about whatever issues he/she would like
mentoring for. There will be roughly $100 in funds for each junior
faculty member for these small group mentoring lunches at the
[UMass Faculty Club](http://www.umassuclub.com/). Your mentors will
receive a small research stipend as a token of appreciation. 

At the fall orientation, we decided that the mentoring lunches should
be used for developing research interest/questions for organization of
both the working groups in the bootcamp and the theme for the Spring
workshop, in addition to being used for discussion of other mentoring
issues. For developing these ideas, we proposed two phases for the
lunches, the first for initial generation/discussion of ideas within
already proposed mentoring networks, and the second for further
discussion by groups organized around the ideas:

1. Lunches within mentoring networks ** by October 31, 2013 **

*Goals: work out research ideas of interest for working group,
  brainstorm questions for workshop theme, discuss mentoring issues about tenure, grants, etc.*

2. Lunches with brainstorming groups ** by November 27, 2013 **

*Goals: develop plans for working group for bootcamp, further brainstorming*

We also decided to share notes from these lunches, which I'll post in
the section below.

#### <a id="lunch-notes"></a> Notes from lunches ####

#### <a id="lunch-procedure"></a> Arranging mentoring lunches through grant funds ####

The procedure for junior faculty to arrange mentoring lunches through grant funds is as
follows:

1. Contact Tom Maxfield, our stalwart grant funds manager **no later than 2 days before your lunch**
    * Tom's office phone number: (413) 545-0889
    * Tom's e-mail: maxfield at linguist dot umass dot edu
2. Provide the following information:
    * Subject: Mellon Prosody Grant mentoring lunch reservation
    * Lunch details
	    1. Date/time
		2. People in attendance
3. Tom will then reserve a spot for you at the Faculty Club and let
   them know what account to charge the lunch to. You will need
   to sign off on the bill, but you won't need to pay anything. Don't
   forget to write in a tip on the bill!
   
4. After the lunch, send me an e-mail with your notes from the lunch
   on ideas for working groups, the theme for the workshop, and anything you want to
   share you learned about tenure, funding, etc. *Include the date of the
   lunch and people involved* because I need to report it to our funders.

Here's the current list of mentoring networks:

##<a id="orientation"></a> Fall orientation ##

We launched the prosody group with an informal get-together when
school starts, on *Wednesday, September 4, 5:30pm - 6:30pm*, in South
College 301 (Partee Seminar Room), UMass. We had introductions, discussed the
organization of the mentoring lunches, winter bootcamp, and spring
workshop, and firmed up dates for the bootcamp and workshop.  

-----------------------------------------

##<a id="bootcamp"></a> Winter bootcamp ##

A 3-day prosody bootcamp will be held at UMass in January 2014, *Wednesday to Friday, January 15-17*, open to
whoever's interested from the Five Colleges community, including
students. The purpose of the bootcamp is to:

1. Establish working groups and brainstorm research projects and
   collaborations (working groups)
2. Share fundamental methodological/background expertise (plenary
   tutorials and lectures)
3. Share targeted methodological expertise and research directions
   (working groups)
4. Discover juicy research questions and get inspired to grapple with
   them  (plenary lectures, and well, everything really)

#### Location and schedule ####

We discussed three possible locations at the fall orientation, which
we are scouting. Stay tuned for final location details.

1. Integrated Sciences Building (KY, CEC)
2. Du Bois Library Learning Commons (different place for plenaries?) (JK)
3. Commonwealth College (JH)

Here is a rough idea of the schedule for each day:

Time  |  Activity 
-------------------- |:-------------:  
9:00-9:30 | Breakfast
9:30-11:00 | Working groups breakout
11:00-12:00 | Plenary lecture, Part I
12:00-13:00 | Lunch break
13:00-14:00 | Plenary lecture, Part II 
14:00-14:15 | Short break
14:15-15:15 | Plenary tutorial, Part I
15:15-15:30 | Short break
15:30-16:30 | Plenary tutorial, Part II
16:30-17:30 | Working groups breakout

<p></p>

#### Working groups ####

At the fall orientation, we decided to institute a fairly organic
process for divying ourselves up into working groups, based on shared
research interests which will be identified and developed during the
mentoring small group lunches. Stay tuned here for more on ideas that
come out of those lunches.

<p></p>

#### Tentative plenary tutorials ####

1. Interpreting the speech signal in prosodic research (Meghan Armstrong, Mara Breen, Kristine Yu)
2. Prosodic transcription (Meghan Armstrong, Mara Breen, Kristine Yu)

At the fall orientation, we discussed including aspects connected with
prosody such as information structure as part of the tutorial.

#### Tentative lunchtime plenary lectures ####

The lineup of lectures is the following:

1. Prosodic interfaces: Angelika Kratzer and Lisa Selkirk (Friday, Jan. 17)
2. Prosody and sentence processing: Chuck Clifton and Lyn Frazier
3. Tone: John Kingston
4. Advising, teaching, research: John McCarthy

The goal of the plenary lectures is to help illuminate big picture
issues for each of the topics like:

1. What are the fundamental questions?
2. What are the fundamental results?
3. Where is the subfield going?
4. What do you think are the exciting research questions?

-----------------------------------------

##<a id="workshop"></a> Spring workshop ##

A 2-day prosody workshop at UMass open to the public will be held in
May 2014, *Friday and Saturday, May 30-31*, and will
(tentatively) consist of:

1. Long invited talks and (planned?) response/discussion for each talk
2. Refereed poster session on the theme
3. Panel discussion on building an integrative prosody community
4. A synthesizing panel discussion at the end of the workshop
5. Lots of time for informal discussion

The theme of the workshop will be decided by the grant group
participants in early November. Tentatively, we brought up the idea of
having a second meeting to discuss the workshop theme then.
