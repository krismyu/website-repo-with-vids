##<a id="lunches"></a> Mentoring networks and lunches ##

Each junior faculty member will invite **2-3** other faculty members to be
mentors, according to the following guidelines:

1. At least one mentor should be inside your home department
2. At least one mentor should be outside your home department
3. At least one mentor should be senior faculty
4. At least one mentor should be junior (or recently tenured) faculty
5. Mentors need not be currently listed as [personnel](#personnel) on
   the grant (we can add them later)

The point of the mentoring network is to be a resource for the initiating
junior faculty member regarding career issues like getting tenure and
funding, how UMass/the department works, teaching, work-life balance,
etc., as well as research ideas and collaborations. 

Over the academic year, each junior faculty member will invite his/her
mentors to lunch to chat about whatever issues he/she would like
mentoring for. There will be roughly $100 in funds for each junior
faculty member for these small group mentoring lunches at the
[UMass Faculty Club](http://www.umassuclub.com/). Your mentors will
receive a small research stipend as a token of appreciation. 

#### <a id="lunch-procedure"></a> Arranging mentoring lunches through grant funds ####

The procedure for junior faculty to arrange mentoring lunches through grant funds is as
follows:

1. Contact Tom Maxfield, our stalwart grant funds manager **no later than 2 days before your lunch**
    * Tom's office phone number: (413) 545-0889
    * Tom's e-mail: maxfield at linguist dot umass dot edu
2. Provide the following information:
    * Subject: Mellon Prosody Grant mentoring lunch reservation
    * Lunch details
	    1. Date/time
		2. People in attendance
3. Tom will then reserve a spot for you at the Faculty Club and let
   them know what account to charge the lunch to. You will need
   to sign off on the bill, but you won't need to pay anything. Don't
   forget to write in a tip on the bill!

-----------------------------------------

##<a id="orientation"></a> Fall orientation ##

We'll launch the prosody group with an informal get-together when
school starts, on *Wednesday, September 4, 5:30pm - 6:30pm*, in South
College 301 (Partee Seminar Room), UMass.  

-----------------------------------------

##<a id="bootcamp"></a> Winter bootcamp ##

A 3-day prosody bootcamp will be held at UMass in January 2014, *tentatively
Wednesday to Friday, January 15-17 OR Thursday to Saturday, January 16-18*, open to
whoever's interested from the Five Colleges community, including
students. The purpose of the bootcamp is to:

1. Establish working groups and brainstorm research projects and
   collaborations (working groups)
2. Share fundamental methodological/background expertise (plenary
   tutorials and lectures)
3. Share targeted methodological expertise and research directions
   (working groups)
4. Discover juicy research questions and get inspired to grapple with
   them  (plenary lectures, and well, everything really)

#### Tentative working groups ####

Here are some tentative working groups, with potential organizers
listed. The job of the organizers for a working group is to plan and
direct the working group's activities during breakout sessions at the
bootcamp. Activities may include tutorials, brainstorming, etc. We'll
try to arrange the schedule so that people with multiple areas of interest can
attend multiple working groups.

Area of interest  | Organizers
----------------- | -------------
Acquisition | Luiz Amaral, Meghan Armstrong, Jeremy Hartman, Magda Oiry
Clinical applications | ?, Meghan Armstrong, (Kristine Yu)
Fieldwork | Seth Cable, Emiliana Cruz, Kristine Yu
On-line processing | Mara Breen, Brian Dillon, Adrian Staub
Phonetics/phonology | Meghan Armstrong, Mara Breen, Kristine Yu
Syntax/semantics/pragmatics | Seth Cable, Brian Dillon, Jeremy Hartman, (Vincent Homer), Adrian Staub

<p></p>

#### Tentative plenary tutorials ####

1. Interpreting the speech signal in prosodic research (Meghan Armstrong, Mara Breen, Kristine Yu)
2. Prosodic transcription (Meghan Armstrong, Mara Breen, Kristine Yu)

#### Tentative lunchtime plenary lectures ####

1. Prosodic interfaces: Angelika Kratzer and Lisa Selkirk
2. Prosody and sentence processing: Chuck Clifton and Lyn Frazier
3. Advising, teaching, research (and some tone?): John Kingston and John McCarthy

-----------------------------------------

##<a id="workshop"></a> Spring workshop ##

A 2-day prosody workshop at UMass open to the public will be held in
May 2014, *tentatively Thursday and Friday, May 29-30 or Friday and Saturday, May 30-31*, and will
(tentatively) consist of:

1. Invited talks (~30 min each)
2. Poster session? 
3. Panel discussion on building an integrative prosody community
4. A synthesizing panel discussion at the end of the workshop
5. Lots of time for informal discussion

The theme of the workshop is: **the definition of tonal concepts: from
the speech signal to grammar**.

Tentative issues to be addressed (feel free to contact me with more
suggestions of topics and potential speakers to invite!) include:

* What are phonetic and phonological spaces for defining tonal concepts?
* What is the locus of contrast for tonal concepts? Morphology?
  Phonology? Pragmatic meaning? Is this different from word-level, to
  sentence-level, to discourse-level prosody?
* How are tonal concepts represented in the grammar and what empirical
  evidence do we have that bears on this?
* Are there differences in the succinctness of grammatical tonal
  representations under consideration by linguists?
* What role do memory and frequency effects play in recognizing tonal concepts?
